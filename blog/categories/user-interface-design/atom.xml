    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a front-end user experience engineer. I was coding a promotional carousel for my company's homepage. The carousel cycles through a list of offers. Each offer slides in from the right and pushes the previous offer out to the left. Nothing special, all  standard behavior.</p>

<p>Another requirement is to show or hide the left and right navigation buttons when user mouse-over or mouse-off the carousel, respectively.No problem, a little Javascript and testing, the job is done.</p>

<p>After finishing the requirements, and played a little more with the carousel, I felt something desirable about the navigation buttons. They show or hide so abrupt to me, especially against the nice transition of the promotion slides. Maybe they can be transitioned in and out in some ways. First thought on this is to check out our design specs. Our company does provide very professional wireframe, visual design and specifications. Great for development. But, I don't remember seeing anything in the specs about transitions. Things like elastic transitions from left to right, start point and end point, etc.</p>

<p>Something hit me at the moment. We might still live in a static world on user interface design and development! Do we? And I think I understand why. Even after 15 to 20 years of evolution of web technologies, animation or motion design are still young. With the latest HTML5 and CSS3, we started to see specifications on how to apply them and 'move' our HTML elements on the screen.</p>

<p>Aha, great! We could do animations easily now with the standard CSS3. But, before we get too excited. We need to ask ourselves. Should we? And how.</p>

<p>Personally, I think meaningful transitions in user interface will greatly enhance user experience! We live in a physical world! We won't feel natural when we see a physical table or object shows or disappears in front of us. Or jumped from one location to another. And why should we accept that in our user interface, just because we can't do that easily?</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems we are trying to solve in user interface design is user orientation. Show the user why they are in our site, content wise at the least. After so many trials and errors, we have standardized on using navigation bars, breadcrumbs and menus. That's all good. But, how about adding some meaningful transitions to the drop-down menus? Drop-down menu can be transitioned from its parent menu position to its final drop-downed position in a physical fashion. Transition back to its original position when it is not needed. This meaningful transition helps to orient user and provides context.</p>

<p>I am not alone. When I tried to research on the title for this blog, I found this site. <a href="http://www.ui-transitions.com">Meaningful Transitions</a>. Highly recommend it!</p>

<p>Forget about this blog. Just read that site. It said it all and a lot more!</p>
